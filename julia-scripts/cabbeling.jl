# # Cabbeling simulation
#
# Convection driven by density gradients appearing because of the mixing of 
# cold and hot water at the same denisty. This is cause by the nonlinearity of the equation of state of water. 
# We start with a stable fluid, with hot water (7.55ᵒ C) above cold water (1ᵒ C). 
# The fluid is initially at rest because the density is constant in the domain, but mixing of cold and hot water
# generates temperatures that correspond to higher density (the maximum density of fresh water is at 4ᵒ C) and
# the mixed water starts to sink.
